<h1>Integrators</h1>

<p>
The integrator is the routine which actually moves the atoms,
depending on the current forces and velocities. The active integrator
is selected in the parameter file via the <tt>ensemble</tt> parameter.
Currently, each integrator to be used must be enabled at compile time.</p>

<p>
There are integrators simulating different <a href="#ensembles">
thermodynamic ensembles</a>, integrators used for <a href="#relaxation">
relaxation simulations</a>, and some <a href="#specialint"> special
purpose integrators</a> for the simulation of fracture, shear flow, separate electronic temperature (TTM) 
or heat conduction.</p>

<p>
Each integrator requires the use of a suitable 
<a href="units.html#timestep">time step</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="ensembles" name="ensembles">
Thermodynamic Ensembles</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>nve</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Constant volume, constant energy ensemble. This is the most reliable
integrator, and thus the main work horse. No particular parameters
are needed, except perhaps the initial temperature starttemp, if not 
all atoms have their velocities given in the configuration file.</p></dd>

<dt><b>nvt</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Constant volume, constant temperature ensemble, with 
Nos&eacute;-Hoover thermostat (more precisely, this is an 
ensemble with external temperature control - the temperature
can actually vary during the simulation). The imposed temperature
varies linearly from starttemp to endtemp (parameters).
A further required parameter is the <a href="units.html#temp_control">
time constant of the temperature control</a>, tau_eta. 
Alternatively, the inverse of tau_eta, inv_tau_eta, can be specified. 
For historical reasons, even the squared inverse isq_tau_eta is 
accepted. inv_tau_eta or isq_tau_eta can be zero, which means 
constant energy simulation (nve). 
If the option <a href="uniax.html">UNIAX</a> is switched on, an 
additional parameter tau_eta_rot is required. It provides the 
time constant for the coupling to the heat bath adjusting the 
temperature for rotational motion. Like tau_eta, its inverse 
inv_tau_eta, or its squared inverse isq_tau_eta, can be used
as parameter.</p></dd>

<dt><b>and</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is actually an option which can be used together with the 
nve or mik integrators. Every <tt>tempintv</tt> steps, the velocities
are reinitialized to a random maxwell distribution of the imposed 
external temperature, which is linearly interpolated between 
<tt>starttemp</tt> and <tt>endtemp</tt>. With the nve integrator, 
this corresponds to an NVT ensemble with Anderson thermostat.</p></dd>

<dt><b>finnis</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Local temperature control which resembles an electronic heat bath for the
ions according to Finns et al (PRB 44, p.567, 1999). It is basically a 
simplyfied implementation of ftg.</p></dd>

<dt><b>npt_iso</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Constant pressure, constant temperature ensemble, with isotropic 
volume scaling. Nos&eacute;-Hoover type thermostat and volume control 
are employed. <a href="units.html#temp_control">Temperature control</a> 
is as in nvt, with the same parameters. (Again, if the option  
<a href="uniax.html">UNIAX</a> is switched on, an additional 
parameter tau_eta_rot is required.) The pressure varies linearly 
from pressure_start to pressure_end (parameters). A 
<a href="units.html#press_control">time constant for pressure control</a>, 
tau_xi, or its inverse inv_tau_xi, or its squared inverse, isq_tau_xi, 
is required as a parameter. If inv_tau_xi or isq_tau_xi is zero, 
the volume remains constant. The cell subdivision includes a 
rescaling tolerance cell_size_tol (parameter), which defaults to 
0.05. If this tolerance is exceeded, the cell subdivision is 
changed on the fly.</p></dd>

<dt><b>npt_axial</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Constant pressure, constant temperature ensemble, 
with volume rescaling along each axis independently.
This works only for <b>orthogonal boxes</b> correctly. 
Works the same way as npt_iso, with the same parameters, except that
the three axial pressures can be specified separately.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2><a id="relaxation" name="relaxation">
Relaxators</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>mik</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Microconvergence integrator. After each step, if the velocity of an
atom goes "uphill" in the potential landscape, it is reset to zero. 
No particular parameter is needed, except perhaps the initial
temperature, if not all atoms have their velocities given in the 
configuration file.</p></dd>

<dt><b>glok</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is a global version of the mik integrator: if the scalar product 
of the global force and momentum vectors (containing the force and
momentum components of all atoms) is negative (momentum goes "uphill"
in the potential landscape), all momenta are reset to zero. Note that 
this concerns only translational forces and momenta, not the
rotational ones in <a href="uniax.html">UNIAX</a>. The momenta are 
also reset to zero if the atoms are getting too fast, i.e., the 
kinetic energy per atom exceeds the value of the parameter 
<tt>glok_ekin_threshold</tt>. In some situations, glok relaxes 
considerably faster than mik.</p></dd>

<dt><b>cg</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The conjugate gradient relaxator cg is controlled by the following
parameters. <tt>linmin_tol</tt> is the tolerance in the line
minimization. This is usually the only parameter that needs to
be set. The number of interations in line minimization is limited
by <tt>linmin_maxsteps</tt> (default <tt>100</tt>. The step width
attempted in the first line minimization is given by 
<tt>linmin_dmax</tt> (default <tt>0.01</tt>). In the following
line minimizations, the optimal step width from the previous line 
minimization is used. <tt>cg_infolevel = 1</tt> enables some 
diagnostic messages. <tt>cg_fr = 1</tt> enables the Fletcher-Reeves 
variant of cg; by default, the Polak-Ribiere variant is used. 
If <tt>cg_reset_int</tt> (default 0) is positive, the cg history
is reset every <tt>cg_reset_int</tt> steps.
</p></dd>

<dt><b><a id="relaxcontrol" name="relaxcontrol">relaxation control</a></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Relaxation simulations with the relaxators mik, glok, and cg, are 
controlled by the following common parameters. A sample is regarded 
as <b>sufficiently relaxed</b>, if one of the following conditions
is satisfied: the kinetic energy per atom is below <tt>ekin_threshold</tt>,
the <a href="options.html#fnorm">force norm</a> is below 
<tt>fnorm_threshold</tt>, or the absolute value of the potential
energy change since the last step is below <tt>delta_epot_threshold</tt>.
The computation of these quantities is automatically enabled. 
The threshold values are zero by default, but one or several of them 
can be set to a positive value in the parameter file.</p>
<p>
If the sample is sufficiently relaxed, a snapshot of the configuration
is written (snapshot files, with an ending .ss, have the same format 
as checkpoints, but a separate numbering). Moreover, if the 
<a href="options.html#deform">deform option</a> is active 
(<tt>max_deform_int > 0</tt>), the next deformation step is performed, 
and the relaxation starts again. Further, if <a href="options.html#fbc">
force boundary conditions</a> are active, and the force increment 
<tt>extra_dforce</tt> is non-zero, it is added to the boundary forces,
and the relaxation starts again. If neither the deform option or force 
boundaries are active, the current simulation phase is terminated.</p>
<p>
Note that for a relaxation simulation with mik or glok, the timestep
can often be chosen much larger than for a proper molecular dynamics
simulation. A factor of 10 larger is often non unreasonable. A little
experimentation may be needed to find the largest timestep, for which
the simulation still converges. Since time has little meaning in a
relaxation context, the number of force computations, nfc, is written 
to the .eng file instead of the time, if some relaxator is compiled 
into IMD (this is so even for an annealing phase with nve or nvt
before the relaxation). For mik or glok relaxators, nfc agrees with 
the step number, but for the cg integrator a single step may comprise 
a large number of force computations. Since the force computation
takes the main part of the simulation time, nfc allows for a fair 
comparison of the speed of convergence between different integrators.
</p></dd>

<dt><b>pressure relaxation</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
In combination with relaxation integrators, pressure relaxation can
be switched on by setting the parameter <tt>relax_rate</tt> to a
positive (sufficiently small) value. At each step, the pressure tensor 
of the sample is then calculated, and the box size and shape is
changed by a small amount in order to lower that pressure. The 
parameters <tt>bulk_module</tt> and <tt>shear_module</tt>, given in 
<a href="units.html">units of pressure</a>, can be used to specify
the sensitivity of the pressure tensor to box changes. With correctly 
set bulk and shear modules, a value of 0.1 - 0.5 for the
<tt>relax_rate</tt> seems to work well. For higher values, the
system might become unstable due to pressure fluctuations, which
can be quite large initially. If large volume changes are needed
to relax the pressure, or if the estimate for the elastic constants
is not accurate enough, a smaller value may be necessary. If the 
bulk and shear modules are not given, they default to 1. Some 
experimentation with <tt>relax_rate</tt> should then quickly reveal 
a usable value.
<p>
</p>
The parameter <tt>relax_mode</tt>, which can take 
values <tt>full</tt>, <tt>axial</tt>, and <tt>iso</tt>, determines wich
part of the pressure tensor is relaxed. <tt>full</tt> means full
relaxation, <tt>axial</tt> means relaxation of pressure along
main axes of a rectangular box, and <tt>iso</tt> relaxes the scalar
pressure by isotropic rescaling of the box. All pressure relaxation 
modes require the compile option <a href="options.html#homdef">homdef</a>,
and modes <tt>full</tt> and <tt>axial</tt> also the compile option
<a href="options.html#stress_tens">stress</a>. Default mode is
<tt>full</tt> if <a href="options.html#stress_tens">stress</a>
is compiled, and <tt>iso</tt> otherwise.
</p>
<p>
If option <a href="options.html#stress_tens">stress</a> is compiled,
it is also possible to relax to a given external pressure tensor read
from the parameter file, in the following form:
<pre>
    presstens_ext  xx yy xy             # 2D  
    presstens_ext  xx yy zz yz zx xy    # 3D
</pre>
The default for <tt>presstens_ext</tt> is zero. All three relaxation
modes are supported. If <tt>relax_mode = axial</tt>, only the diagonal
pressure components are relaxed, and if <tt>relax_mode = iso</tt>,
only the isotropic pressure is relaxed to the average of the
diagonal components. In any case, the full <tt>presstens_ext</tt>
must be given, even if some of its components are ignored.

<dl>

<dt><b>frac</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fracture simulation with stadium damping according to Gumbsch et al. 
(PRB 55, p.3445, 1997). The crack (x: propagation direction, y: crack
plane, z: 2D or pbc) can propagate within the nve ensemble in an 
elliptical "stadium" (characterized by center and stadium (= half axes)).
Outside this inner ellipse viscous damping or nvt temperature control is
applied (depending on dampingmode). The damping is characterized by the
damping coefficient gamma_bar which should be around 2*omega_E.
The ramping of the damping depends on the ratio stadium.x/box.x, i.e full
damping at the border of the box. With stadium2 one can introduce an
outer ellipse outside which full damping is applied, the slope of the
damping thus depends on the ratio stadium.x/stadium2.x. Additionally the 
sample can be strained at strainrate in y direction.</p></dd>

<dt><b>sllod</b></dt>
<dd>
<p> 
SLLOD ensemble for simulation of shear flow
with the help of a deformation rate tensor in combination with
Lees-Edwards boundary conditions. It corresponds to an additional
velocity component applied to every particle in every step. It appears
also in the equation of the momenta so that the particles perform a
motion relatively to the shear flow. The SLLOD algorithm
<b>must</b> be used together with a thermostat and with
periodic boundary conditions in all directions. In 2D a vector
shear_rate must be specified whose two components correspond to the
xy- resp. to the yx-component of the applied deformation rate
tensor. In 3D two vectors with three components, shear_rate and
shear_rate2 must be specified. The components of shear_rate specify
its yz-, the zx-, and its xy-component. The components of shear_rate2
specify its zy-, the xz-, and its yx-component.</p></dd>

<dt><a id="ttm" name="ttm"><b>ttm</b></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Basic nve integrator that has been enhanced for metallic samples far from thermal equilibrium, as they occur for example in simulations of laser ablation with ultrashort pulses. This has been achieved by implementing a hybrid method for the Two Temperature Model (TTM), which assigns separate temperatures to the subsystem of the conduction electrons (T_e) and to the lattice (T_p).
</p><p>
The differential equation for the electronic temperature is solved in a continuum ansatz on a discretised lattice with a finite difference (FD) method. Every node/cell of this FD-lattice corresponds to a cuboid in simulation space comprised of a number of MD cells. The local lattice temperature is derived by averaging over the atoms in said space, and the energetic coupling between the two systems is made possible by a damping term in the integrator proportional to the local temperature difference (see D. S. Ivanov, L. V. Zhigilei, Phys. Rev. B <b>68</b>, 064114 (2003) for details).
</p><p>
This integrator is still a little awkward to use, and subject to limitations: All materials parameters are constants (except for the electronic heat capacity c_e, which can be made proportional to the electronic temperature by use of the parameter fd_gamma). Aborted simulations cannot be restarted from snapshots but only from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Necessary Parameters: fd_k, fd_c or fd_gamma, fd_g, fd_n_timesteps, fd_ext.
Optional Parameters: fd_update_steps, ttm_int, init_t_el, fix_t_el.
</p>
<p>
The subdivision of the simulation volume into FD cells has to be supplied by the user and depends on the dimensions of the automatically generated MD cell arrays. This must be done with the parameter fd_ext, which takes a vector of integers that give the number of MD cells per FD cell in the coordinate directions of the simulation space. If one of these values is selected too large, so the resulting MD cells would be smaller than the minimal cell size (cutoff radius of the potential), IMD will issue an error and exit. Otherwise, the MD cell size is automatically set to a value that allows the simulation space of a single process to be completely filled by tiling FD cells of size fd_ext, i.e. global_cell_dim.x%(cpu_dim.x*fd_ext.x)==0.
</p>
<p>
To obtain the MD cell array dimensions, one short test run with the input checkpoint file and the desired cpu_dim can be done. Example: A test run with two processes (without ttm code) yields the following output:

</pre>
<p>
Here, the sample has a size of 5.969499*1018 x 6.752167*6 x 6.752167*6 or 6076.95 x 40.513 x 40.513 Angstroms. The minimal cell size is 5.96 Angstroms (the cutoff radius of the used potential). Because there are two processes, which are aligned in x direction, the maximum values for fd_ext are 509 6 6. Note that choosing large (albeit allowed) values without considering the minimal cell size may result in MD cells that are larger than necessary, which may slow down the force computation loops, as they scale quadratically with the number of atoms per MD cell.

</p>
<p>
The ttm code adds a column to the .eng file with the average electronic energy per atom E_el. Note that this is _not_ the electronic temperature and will likely differ from the average lattice temperature in the same file even for a relaxed sample. In order to look at electron temperatures, assign a non-zero value to the parameter ttm_int and use the information from the *.ttm files. When compiled with the debug option, there will be some more columns in the .eng file that will be useless if the code runs correctly.
</p>
<p>
For reasons of numerical stability, the timestep of the MD part and of the FD part of the simulation differ. In general, the FD timestep is smaller by a factor fd_n_timesteps, which must be given as a parameter. It has to fulfill the <a id="ttm_criterion" name="ttm_criterion">stability criterion</a>
n&gt;2*timestep*fd_k/(h*min(c_e)),
with h the minimum thickness of the FD cells (1*5.969499 in the example, because it is smaller than 6*6.752167) and min(c_e) the minimum electronic heat capacity to expect in the whole course of the simulation (i.e. fd_c, or alternatively fd_gamma multiplied by the lowest expected electron temperature).

</p>
<p>
If you choose a wrong (i.e., too small) value for fd_n_timesteps, bad things may happen, including periodic temperature fluctuations, growing exponentially in time, and negative electron temperatures.
