<h3>Authors</h3>

<p>IMD was originally developed by the late J&ouml;rg Stadler in the framework
of Project C14 "Molekulardynamik von Quasikristallen"</a>
of the Collaborative Research Centre 382 
"Verfahren und Algorithmen zur Simulation physikalischer 
Prozesse auf Hochleistungsrechnern" from 1995 to 2006.</p> 

<p>J&ouml;rg Stadler left the ITAP in summer 1997. Further
contributors have been Philipp Beck, Erik Bitzek, Marco Brunelli, Dietmar Bunz,
  Christian Dilger, Peter Gumbsch, Jutta Hahn, Adham Hashibon, Martin Hohl,
  Christof Horn, 
  Jutta Kaiser, Johannes Karlin, Uli Koschella, Christopher Kohler, Felix Krul,
  Yu Chieh Lo, Yuri Mishin, Ralf Mikulla, Matthias M&uuml;ller, Frank Pister,
  Dennis Rapp, Christoph Rudhart, Gunther Schaaf, Daniel Schopf, Steffen
  Sonntag, Christian Ulrich, Dieter Wolfangel, and Gabi Zeger.</p>

<p>The development of IMD has been continued by a team including Andreas
  Chatzopoulos, Christoph Begau, Erik Bitzek, Peter Brommer, Franz G&auml;hler,
  Sudheer Ganisetti, Alexander Kiselev, Johannes M&ouml;ller, Arun Prakash,
  Johannes Roth, Godehard Sutmann. Further funding has been provided
by the Collaborative Research Centre 716 ("Dynamic simulation of systems with large
numbers of particles"), projects B1, B2, B5, and D2 from 2007 to 2018.</p> 

<p>The IMD program is also used at MPI for Intelligent Systems Stuttgart, 
at the IMWF Stuttgart, and at the University of Karlsruhe, Friedrich-Alexander
University of Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg, Ruhr-University Bochum,
University of Pennsylvania and various locations around the
world.</p>

<p> At GitHub, the IMD repository is provided as it is and will no longer be maintained 
  since no further public funding is provided for development.
The IMD community, however, is still actively implementing new features and impoving the code, 
  especially in the field of simulating laser ablation and studying 3d laser printing. 
  The latest versions are available upon request.
