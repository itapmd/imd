<p>IMD was originally developed by J&ouml;rg Stadler in the framework
of Project C14 "Molekulardynamik von Quasikristallen"</a>
of the Collaborative Research Centre 382 
"Verfahren und Algorithmen zur Simulation physikalischer 
Prozesse auf Hochleistungsrechnern".</p> 

<p>J&ouml;rg Stadler left the ITAP in summer 1997. Further
contributors have been Erik Bitzek, Marco Brunelli, Dietmar Bunz,
Martin Hohl, Christof Horn, Jutta Kaiser, Ralf Mikulla, Matthias
M&uuml;ller, Christoph Rudhart, Gunther Schaaf, Christian Ulrich, and
Dieter Wolfangel.</p>

<p>The development of IMD has been continued by a team including Erik
Bitzek, Peter Brommer, Franz G&auml;hler, Christopher Kohler, Frank
Pister, Johannes Roth, and Steffen Sonntag. Further funding has been provided
by the Collaborative Research Centre 716 ("Dynamic simulation of systems with large
numbers of particles"), projects B1, B2, B5, and D2.</p> 

<p>The program is also used at MPI f&uuml;r Metallforschung Stuttgart,
MPA Stuttgart, and at the University of Karlsruhe, Friedrich-Alexander
University of Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg, Ruhr-University Bochum,
University of Pennsylvania and various institutes around the
world.</p>
